ðŸš€ Step-by-Step Deployment on Railway
Follow these steps to deploy the Serverless1 project on Railway.

Step 1: Set Up the Project in GitHub
Create a GitHub Repository: If you havenâ€™t already, create a repository on GitHub for Serverless1.
Upload Project Files: Ensure that index.html and any associated files (e.g., JavaScript files) are in the repositoryâ€™s root directory.
Commit Changes: Once all files are added, commit and push the changes to the main branch on GitHub.
Step 2: Set Up a Railway Account and Connect GitHub
Sign Up/In to Railway: Go to Railway.app and sign in or create an account.
Connect GitHub: In Railwayâ€™s dashboard, go to settings and link your GitHub account. This will allow Railway to access your repositories for deployment.
Step 3: Deploy the Project on Railway
Create a New Project:

On the Railway dashboard, click on New Project.
Select Deploy from GitHub repo to deploy from an existing GitHub repository.
Select the Repository:

Choose the Serverless1 repository from the list.
Railway will automatically detect that it is a static project and set up the environment.
Configure Settings:

Root Directory: In the Settings tab of Railway, set the Root Directory to / if it isnâ€™t set automatically. This ensures Railway serves the files from the root folder.
Generate a Public Domain:

Go to the Settings tab in Railway and scroll to Networking.
Under Public Networking, click Generate Domain. Enter 8080 as the target port if prompted.
Railway will create a public URL for your application, such as https://serverless1-production.up.railway.app.
Step 4: Access the Application
Open the Generated URL:

Copy the URL provided by Railway (e.g., https://serverless1-production.up.railway.app).
Open it in a browser to test and use the application.
